Subtropical; ? - 26°C ; 46°N - 30°N, 81°W - 64°W ","Distribution":"Western Atlantic: Nova Scotia, Canada southward to Indian River, Florida, USA.","Short description":"Dorsal spines (total): 0; Dorsal soft rays (total): 18-24; Anal spines: 0; Anal soft rays: 18 - 24. Upper jaw with median notch. Pelvic fin with rounded hind margin, inner fin rays equal or nearly equal to outer fin rays when fin folded back. Pre-dorsal scales modified; scales on back, above base of anal fin and at base of tail much smaller and irregularly placed. A black spot behind gill opening, followed along flank by approximately 6 lines of smaller spots . Silvery, with brassy sides and a dark bluish green back .","Biology":"Found inshore in summer, but at least some moving into deeper water in winter. Adults are found in near surface waters , usually in shallow areas overlying continental shelf, in greatest abundance immediately adjacent to major estuaries . Juveniles are also generally pelagic, with smallest size groups farthest up river . Form large and very compact schools, both of juveniles and adults. Migrate north - south; also in and out of bays and inlets. Feed by filtering phytoplankton (diatoms ) and zooplankton (small crustaceans, annelid worms and detritus ). High water temperatures apparently limit breeding. Spawn probably all year; nursery areas in estuaries. Larvae are pelagic , probably spend about a month in waters over continental shelf , entering estuarine waters at about 10 mm and larger . Marketed fresh, salted, canned or smoked. Mainly used for production of oil, fertilizer and fishmeal . Parasites found are isopods, copepod, cestodes and trematodes .","Life cycle":"Breeding season apparently limited by high water temperatures (20.5°C monthly mean maximum). Spawning activity occurring almost every month in some part of the range . Spawning temperature ranges from 4.4°C to 23.6°C, with peak activity at 15-18°C . Salinity ranges from 10 ppt to usually greater than 25 ppt . Fecundity observed is from 38,000 to 631,000 eggs per season .","IUCN":"Least Concern (LC)"}}
